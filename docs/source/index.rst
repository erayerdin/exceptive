Exceptive is a Python library that makes exception handling more programmatic and debuggable. You can define custom
behaviors based on exceptions which might be for logging, validation or any other purpose you desire.

Currently, exceptive bases on two different approaches, you can;

 - either use annotation-based module
 - or use inheritance-based module

Both approaches have their downfalls and uprises and might depend on your choice of architectural design. To have
further detail, see them in their own sections.
